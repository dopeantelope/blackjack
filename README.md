## How It's Made:

A JavaScript web application that utilizes the deck of cards API to randomize a dealer and players hand. Players have the ability to hit which uses a 'draw card' end point, or  players can stand. When a player stands, the dealers card is revealed and the dealer draws cards until the total is greater than or equal to 17. Scores are then compared and a winner is declared. Upon player or dealer bust the game ends.

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Deck of Cards API


## Optimizations

Further optimizations would include a betting feature where the player can bet chips against the dealer. An optimization beyond this would be to introduce side betting typcially seen in BlackJack such as Perfect Pairs and 21+3.
